A `.gitignore` file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project. To ignore the `__pycache__` directories in your Git repository, you need to add a new line with `__pycache__/` in your `.gitignore` file.

Follow these steps:

1. Open Terminal and navigate to your Git repository.

2. Open the `.gitignore` file in a text editor. If you don't have a `.gitignore` file, you can create one using the command `touch .gitignore`.

3. Add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

    ```
    __pycache__/
    ```

4. Save and close the `.gitignore` file.

5. Stage the `.gitignore` file and commit it to your repository:

    ```bash
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Add __pycache__ to .gitignore"
    ```

Now, the `__pycache__` directories and all the files within them will be ignored by Git. This means they won't be included in your commits and won't be pushed to your remote repository. 

This is generally a good practice because these files are generated automatically by Python and don't need to be shared or version-controlled. Each developer's Python environment will generate its own `__pycache__` directories.
