# learning_scripts
general learning scripts!

daily 10-15m learning:
Python first, and then JS, then Solidity, AI etc..

Complete python learning path + bash + selenium and other API based automations using Python scripts.
==> Begin building scripts for work as well as personal life enhancements
==> Data Science projects, full stack web development using Python

Learn JavaScript as well and JS frameworks along with HTML / CSS

Use it all to continue building fun fullstack web dev projects / websites, scripts etc...
Mostly, project based learning from there, branch into AI/ML stuff then too.
The deepest interest for now is to be able to write scripts that do things for me, and enhance my productivity / workflow generally.
