# learning_scripts
Free studies / learning notes where I practice various skillsets to build scripts / learn things.

I plan on mastering all things python, then JavaScript and its frameworks to become a full stack developer.
Most of the teachings / coaching is done with ChatGPT.
----------


ALL learning is best done on a AI assisted, project based learning. Building real tools that I need to use;
AI to assist in terms of learning new concepts, solution suggestion, code feedback, generating example codes etc...
This is the stickiest.
