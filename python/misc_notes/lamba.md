The `lambda` function, often simply called a lambda, is a way to create small, anonymous functions in Python. These functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned when the lambda is called. Lambdas are often used for short, simple operations that are convenient to define inline, and when a full, named function definition would be overly verbose.

Here's the basic syntax of a lambda function:
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

A few things to note about lambda functions:
- They can't contain multiple expressions or statements.
- They don't have a `return` statement; the single expression's value is returned automatically.
- They don't have a name unless assigned to a variable.

Here are some examples:

1. **Basic lambda function:**
```python
f = lambda x: x + 1
print(f(2))  # Outputs: 3
```

2. **Lambda function with multiple arguments:**
```python
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
print(multiply(3, 4))  # Outputs: 12
```

3. **Using lambda inside functions (often seen with `sorted`, `map`, `filter`, etc.):**
```python
points = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 4)]
sorted_points = sorted(points, key=lambda x: x[1])
print(sorted_points)  # Outputs: [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4)]
```

In the last example, the list of tuples is sorted based on the second element of each tuple, thanks to the lambda function.

While lambda functions are powerful and convenient in many scenarios, they can also make code less readable if overused or used for complex logic. In such cases, it's often clearer to define a named function using the `def` keyword.
