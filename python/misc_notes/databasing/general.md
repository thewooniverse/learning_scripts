Python has a number of different ways to handle database-like functionality beyond just JSON files. Here are a few:

1. **SQLite**: SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration database engine included with Python. SQLite stores data in a single file and can handle quite large amounts of data. It uses SQL syntax, so it's a good step up if you're planning to work with larger SQL databases in the future. Python provides the `sqlite3` module for interacting with SQLite databases.

2. **Pickle**: The `pickle` module in Python implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. It turns Python objects into a byte stream and can store more complex Python objects than JSON, but it's less human-readable and less secure.

3. **Shelve**: Python's `shelve` module is like a dictionary that's stored in a file. It's very simple to use and can persist more complex objects, but it's not as robust or flexible as a proper database.

4. **CSV Files**: If your data is simple and tabular, storing it in a CSV file could be a good option. Python's `csv` module makes it easy to read and write CSV files.

5. **Pandas**: The pandas library offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series which can be written to various formats including CSV, Excel, SQL databases and more.

Remember that these are not replacements for a proper relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB, especially when dealing with larger amounts of data or when you require advanced features like concurrent writes or complex queries. But they are fine for small projects or simple use cases.

Serialization is the process of transforming data into a format that can be stored and then reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. 

When transmitting data or storing them in a file, the data are required to be byte strings, but complex objects are seldom in this format. Serialization can convert these complex objects into byte strings for such use. After the byte strings are transmitted or stored, the byte strings can be deserialized back into the original object.

In Python, the `pickle` module is a common way to serialize and deserialize data. However, it's important to note that `pickle` is not safe or reliable for transmitting data between untrusted parties.

The primary use for serialization is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. This process is also called "object persistence". Other uses include passing objects over a network and storing Python objects in a database.

For example, you might have a Python object representing a player in a game. You could serialize the player object to a file when the game is saved, and then deserialize it back into a Python object when the game is loaded again.
