To implement a simple persistent leaderboard for a text-based game in Python, you could use a combination of Python's built-in features along with some additional libraries. Here's a rough sketch of how it might work:

1. **Data structure**: For in-memory storage during a single session, a data structure like a list of tuples or a list of dictionaries could be used. Each entry would represent a player and their score.

2. **Sorting**: Python's built-in `sorted()` function can be used to sort the leaderboard. If you're using a list of tuples where the first element is the player's name and the second is their score, you could sort it like this: `leaderboard = sorted(leaderboard, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)`. This sorts the list of tuples by the second element of each tuple (the score) in descending order.

3. **Persistence**: To keep the leaderboard data between different sessions, you would need to write the data to a file. There are several ways to do this:

   - **CSV**: Python's `csv` module can be used to write the data to a CSV file and read it back.
   - **JSON**: The `json` module can be used if the data structure is a list of dictionaries, which corresponds directly to a JSON array of objects.
   - **SQLite**: If you need more complex operations, like querying for players with certain scores, you might want to use a SQLite database. Python's `sqlite3` module provides a lightweight disk-based database, which doesn't require a separate server process.
  
4. **Reading the data back**: When the game starts, read the data from the file or database back into memory.

Here's a basic implementation using JSON for data storage:

```python
import json

# Load the leaderboard data
try:
    with open('leaderboard.json', 'r') as f:
        leaderboard = json.load(f)
except FileNotFoundError:
    leaderboard = []

# Add a new score
leaderboard.append({'name': 'new_player', 'score': 123})

# Sort the leaderboard
leaderboard = sorted(leaderboard, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)

# Save the leaderboard data
with open('leaderboard.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(leaderboard, f)
```

This code will maintain a leaderboard that persists between different runs of the program, automatically adding new players and keeping the leaderboard sorted. However, for a more complex or large-scale game, you might want to consider a more robust solution like a full database system.



=================
**Overwriting:**
Yes, opening a file in 'w' mode (write mode) in Python will overwrite the existing file. If the file doesn't exist, it gets created. If it does exist, it gets truncated to zero length before being opened, essentially removing all the previous contents. 

Here's what's happening in the line of code you're asking about:

```python
with open('leaderboard.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(leaderboard, f)
```

This code opens 'leaderboard.json' in write mode. It then uses `json.dump()` to write the JSON representation of `leaderboard` into the file.

If you want to append to a file instead of overwriting it, you would open the file in 'a' mode (append mode). However, for a JSON file, appending usually doesn't make sense because the result wouldn't be valid JSON. In the context of your leaderboard, you usually want to overwrite the whole file because you're storing the entire state of the leaderboard each time.




============
**Explaining sorting**
<!-- leaderboard = sorted(leaderboard, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True) -->

This line of Python code is sorting a list of dictionaries. Let's break it down:

1. `leaderboard` is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a player, and has at least two keys: a player name, and a 'score'.

2. `sorted()` is a built-in Python function that takes an iterable and returns a new sorted list of the elements in the iterable.

3. `key=lambda x: x['score']` tells `sorted()` how to compare the dictionaries. Without a key function, Python wouldn't know how to sort a list of dictionaries. The `key` argument expects a function that takes one argument and returns a value that can be used for the purposes of sorting.

   `lambda x: x['score']` is a small anonymous function that takes a dictionary (which we're temporarily calling `x`), and returns the value of its 'score' key. So, essentially, this is telling Python to sort the dictionaries by their 'score' value.

4. `reverse=True` is telling `sorted()` to sort in descending order, because normally it sorts in ascending order. In the context of your leaderboard, that means players with higher scores will come first.

So, overall, this line of code is reordering the `leaderboard` list so that the player dictionaries with the highest scores come first.
