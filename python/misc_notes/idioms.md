# __name__ = "__main__" idiom
The line `if __name__ == "__main__":` is a Python idiom that is often used to designate the start of the program's execution. When a Python script is executed, Python sets the special variable `__name__` to `"__main__"` for that script. So this line checks whether this script is being run as the main program and not being imported as a module into another script.

If the script is being run directly (not imported), then `__name__` will be `"__main__"`, and the code block following the `if __name__ == "__main__":` line will execute. In this case, it calls the `main()` function to start the program.

This is particularly useful when you write a module and want to be able to test it in isolation (by running it directly), but also want to use it in other modules. Code that you don't want to execute when the script is imported as a module should be placed under the `if __name__ == "__main__":` check. This way, when the script is imported as a module, none of the code under this block will run.
