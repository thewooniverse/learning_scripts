### Network Programming in Python

Network programming is a field that deals with creating programs that can communicate across devices over a network. This area covers a variety of topics including basic networking concepts, protocols, and practical implementation using programming languages, particularly Python in this context.

#### Basic Networking Concepts

##### Core Concepts

1. **TCP/IP**: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is the backbone for almost all internet communications. TCP ensures reliable, ordered data transmission, whereas IP is responsible for routing the packets of data.

2. **Ports**: A port is an endpoint for communication in an operating system. Well-known port numbers exist for specific services (e.g., HTTP runs on port 80).

3. **Protocols**: A set of rules for how data is transmitted and received. HTTP, FTP, and SMTP are examples of networking protocols.

#### Python's `socket` Library

Python has a built-in library called `socket` specifically designed for network-related tasks. The `socket` library provides the capability to create both server and client sockets, allowing for custom networking applications.

##### Example: Basic TCP Server and Client

- **Server**

  ```python
  import socket

  def main():
      server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
      server_socket.bind(('localhost', 12345))
      server_socket.listen(1)

      client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
      print(f"Connection from {address} has been established.")

      client_socket.send(bytes("Hello from server", 'utf-8'))
      client_socket.close()

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

- **Client**

  ```python
  import socket

  def main():
      client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
      client_socket.connect(('localhost', 12345))

      message = client_socket.recv(1024)
      print(message.decode('utf-8'))

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

#### Making HTTP Requests Using `requests`

The `requests` library in Python is used for making various types of HTTP requests like `GET`, `POST`, etc.

##### Example: Fetching Data from REST API

```python
import requests

def main():
    response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(response.json())
    else:
        print('Failed to get data')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Best Practices

- Always close your sockets when done to free up resources.
- Exception handling should be robust, especially in networking where many things can go wrong (e.g., network issues, invalid data, etc.)
- Always check the status code when making HTTP requests to ensure the request was successful.

This chapter gives you a foundational understanding of networking in Python, covering everything from the basic concepts of networking to making HTTP requests. It combines theory with practical examples, paving the way for deeper exploration and more complex projects.
