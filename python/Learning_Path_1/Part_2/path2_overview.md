Great! I will provide resources and examples for each of the topics in Part 2: Intermediate Python, as well as guide you on the project. Let's get started.

**1. Advanced Data Structures: Stacks, Queues, and Trees**

   - **Stacks**: A stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure. Python's built-in list type makes a decent stack data structure as it supports push and pop operations in amortized O(1) time. 
   ```python
   # Stack implementation in Python
   stack = []
   stack.append('a')  # push 'a' to stack
   stack.append('b')  # push 'b' to stack
   print(stack.pop())  # pop item from stack
   ```

   - **Queues**: A queue is a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure. Python's `collections.deque` can be used as a queue as it has O(1) time complexity for appendleft() and popleft() operations.
   ```python
   # Queue implementation in Python
   from collections import deque
   queue = deque()
   queue.append('a')  # enqueue 'a'
   queue.append('b')  # enqueue 'b'
   print(queue.popleft())  # dequeue item
   ```

   - **Trees**: The most common type of tree in Computer Science is a binary tree. Python does not have built-in support for trees, so they have to be implemented as custom classes.
   ```python
   # Binary Tree implementation in Python
   class Node:
       def __init__(self, value):
           self.left = None
           self.right = None
           self.value = value
   root = Node('a')  # create root node
   root.left = Node('b')  # add left child
   root.right = Node('c')  # add right child
   ```

**2. Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**

   Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. In Python, you can use the `class` keyword to define a class and `def` to define methods. Inheritance and polymorphism are advanced OOP concepts that allow you to create hierarchical class structures and use methods in different ways depending on the class.

**3. Exception Handling and Debugging**

   Python uses `try/except` blocks to handle exceptions. The code inside the `try` block is executed, and if it throws an error, the code inside the `except` block is run. The `pdb` module in Python provides a debugger, which allows you to step through your code, examine data, and use breakpoints.

**4. Working with External Libraries**

   Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries that you can use in your projects. You can install a library using `pip`, and then `import` it in your script. For example, the `requests` library is used to make HTTP requests.






**5. Basic Regular Expressions for Pattern Matching**

   Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that form a search pattern. Python's `re` module provides functions to work with regex. You can use regex to check if a string matches a pattern, find all substrings that match a pattern, split a string at each match, and more.








**Project: Command-line Address Book**

For the project, you will build a command-line address book application. This application will allow users to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts. The contacts will be stored in a file, so they persist between runs of the program.

Here

The project you are about to build involves creating a command-line address book application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and view contacts. The information of the contacts will be stored in a file to persist between runs of the program. 

A tutorial from DataFlair provides an example of creating an address book using Python, but it uses the Tkinter library for creating a GUI application【31†source】【32†source】【33†source】【34†source】【35†source】. However, since you're looking to build a command-line application, you can adjust the concepts from this example to suit a command-line interface.

Here's a simple skeleton of what your command-line address book might look like:

```python
class AddressBook:
    def __init__(self):
        self.contacts = {}

    def add_contact(self, name, number):
        self.contacts[name] = number

    def edit_contact(self, name, number):
        if name in self.contacts:
            self.contacts[name] = number

    def delete_contact(self, name):
        if name in self.contacts:
            del self.contacts[name]

    def view_contact(self, name):
        if name in self.contacts:
            return self.contacts[name]

    def view_all_contacts(self):
        return self.contacts
```

You can use this class in a command-line program like this:

```python
def main():
    book = AddressBook()
    while True:
        print("1. Add contact")
        print("2. Edit contact")
        print("3. Delete contact")
        print("4. View contact")
        print("5. View all contacts")
        print("6. Quit")
        choice = input("Choose an option: ")
        if choice == "1":
            name = input("Enter the contact's name: ")
            number = input("Enter the contact's number: ")
            book.add_contact(name, number)
        elif choice == "2":
            name = input("Enter the contact's name: ")
            number = input("Enter the new number: ")
            book.edit_contact(name, number)
        elif choice == "3":
            name = input("Enter the contact's name: ")
            book.delete_contact(name)
        elif choice == "4":
            name = input("Enter the contact's name: ")
            print(book.view_contact(name))
        elif choice == "5":
            print(book.view_all_contacts())
        elif choice == "6":
            break
```

This is a very basic implementation and can be extended based on your needs. For example, you might want to add error checking to ensure that the user inputs are valid before trying to perform operations on the address book.

To make the contacts persist between runs of the program, you can use file I/O operations. Python's built-in `open()`, `read()`, and `write()` functions can be used for this purpose. You can write the contacts to a file in a format of your choice (such as CSV or JSON) when the program exits, and read the contacts from the file when the program starts. If you choose JSON, you can use the `json` module's `dump()` and `load()` functions to write and read the contacts.

Please note that, as always, you should include error handling in your code. Python's `try/except` blocks can be used for this purpose. For example, you should handle the case where the file does not exist when the program starts, or the case where the file cannot be written to when the program exits. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
