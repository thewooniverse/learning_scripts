**Product Overview**

We're building a simple, intuitive command-line address book application. The application will provide a way for users to manage their contacts, with functionality to add, edit, delete, and search contacts. The application will maintain a persistent database that stores user contact information between sessions.

**Target Audience**

The target users for this product are individuals who are comfortable using the command-line interface and prefer it for its speed, simplicity, and efficiency.

**Goals & Objectives**

- To provide an efficient way for users to manage their contacts directly from the command-line interface.
- To ensure data persists between sessions, enabling users to keep their contacts safely stored over time.

**Features & Requirements**

1. **Add Contact:** As a user, I want to be able to add a new contact to my address book. Contact details should include name, phone number, and email address.

2. **Edit Contact:** As a user, I want to be able to edit an existing contact in my address book.

3. **Delete Contact:** As a user, I want to be able to remove a contact from my address book permanently.

4. **Search Contact:** As a user, I want to be able to search for a contact using the person's name or any part of their contact information.

5. **Persistent Data Storage:** As a user, I want my contact information to persist between program runs so that I don't lose data when I close the application.

**Constraints & Limitations**

- The application will be command-line based, which might not appeal to users who prefer graphical user interfaces.
- The application should handle errors gracefully, such as trying to add a contact that already exists or deleting a contact that does not exist.
