Certainly! Here are a few exercises to help you practice the basics of NumPy:

### Exercise 1: Create and Manipulate Arrays
1. Create a one-dimensional NumPy array containing 10 elements filled with zeros.
2. Change the 5th value to 10.
3. Print the array.

### Exercise 2: Basic Array Operations
1. Create two 3x3 matrices `A` and `B`.
2. Perform and print the following operations: `A + B`, `A - B`, `A * B` (element-wise multiplication), and the matrix multiplication of `A` and `B`.

### Exercise 3: Reshaping and Slicing
1. Create a NumPy array of shape (6, 6) filled with random numbers.
2. Extract the first 3 rows and 3 columns as a new array.
3. Reshape the array into a shape of (9, 4) without changing its data.

### Exercise 4: Statistical Functions
1. Create a one-dimensional array of 100 random numbers.
2. Compute and print the mean, median, standard deviation, and sum of the array.

### Exercise 5: Boolean Indexing
1. Create a 5x5 matrix with random integers between 1 and 100.
2. Use boolean indexing to replace all the values greater than 50 with 50.

### Exercise 6: Working with Diagonals and Transpose
1. Create a 4x4 matrix.
2. Print the main diagonal of the matrix.
3. Print the transpose of the matrix.

### Exercise 7: Broadcasting
1. Create a 3x3 array filled with random numbers.
2. Add the one-dimensional array `[1, 2, 3]` to each row of the 3x3 array.
3. Print the result.

### Exercise 8: Solving Linear Equations
1. Create a 3x3 matrix `A` and a one-dimensional array `b` of length 3.
2. Use NumPy's functions to solve the linear equation system `Ax = b`.
3. Print the solution.
