In Python, `assert` is a debugging aid that tests a condition as an internal self-check in your code. If the condition is `True`, the program continues running as usual. If the condition is `False`, the program stops and throws an `AssertionError` exception.

Here is the basic syntax for `assert`:

```python
assert condition, error_message(optional)
```

Here's a quick example of how you might use `assert`:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    assert isinstance(a, (int, float)), "Argument 'a' must be a number."
    assert isinstance(b, (int, float)), "Argument 'b' must be a number."
    return a + b

print(add_numbers(1, 2))  # Prints: 3
print(add_numbers(1, '2'))  # AssertionError: Argument 'b' must be a number.
```

In the example above, the `assert` statements will stop the program if either `a` or `b` is not a number, preventing the function from trying to add together incompatible types and causing a `TypeError`.

However, it's important to note that `assert` should not be used for data validation in a production environment. This is because the `-O` (optimize) flag for the Python interpreter will disable assertions, meaning that any `assert` checks will not be performed. For production-level data validation, you should use explicit conditional checks and raise appropriate exceptions when necessary.
