Absolutely, let's dive deeper into Exception Handling and Debugging in Python:

**1. Understanding Exceptions:**
   
   In Python, exceptions are raised when your program encounters an error (something in the program goes wrong). For instance, trying to divide by zero raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception, and trying to access a nonexistent key in a dictionary raises a `KeyError` exception.

   Python provides a whole hierarchy of built-in exceptions that you can handle in your code: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy

**2. Using `try`/`except`/`finally` Blocks:**

   `try`/`except` blocks are used to catch and handle exceptions. Python executes the code following the `try` keyword. If an exception is thrown, it executes the code following the `except` keyword.

   Here's an example:

   ```python
   try:
       x = 1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       x = 0  # This code is executed instead, and the program continues
   ```

   The `finally` keyword is used to specify a block of code that will be executed no matter if an exception is raised or not.

   Here's an example:

   ```python
   try:
       x = 1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       x = 0  # This code is executed instead
   finally:
       print("This gets executed no matter what")
   ```

**3. Introduction to Debugging in Python:**

   Debugging is an essential part of programming. In Python, you can use the built-in `pdb` module for debugging. 

   You can use it to step through your code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions. To set a breakpoint in your code (a point where the debugger will stop), you can use `pdb.set_trace()`. Here's a quick example:

   ```python
   import pdb

   def divide(x, y):
       pdb.set_trace()  # This will pause the program here when it's run
       return x / y

   print(divide(1, 0))  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
   ```

   When you run this program, it will pause at the call to `pdb.set_trace()`. You can then inspect the values of `x` and `y`, step to the next line, etc.

   In Python 3.7 and later, you can also use the built-in `breakpoint()` function to start the debugger.

These concepts will help you write more robust code and find and fix bugs more easily. Exception handling is a powerful tool for controlling your program's response to a variety of situations, and debugging allows you to understand your code better and find mistakes more efficiently.
