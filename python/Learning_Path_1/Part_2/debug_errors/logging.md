Sure, debugging and logging are essential techniques in Python for identifying and fixing issues in code and for tracking the flow and state of the program over time.

1. **Python's Built-In Debugger (`pdb`):**

`pdb` is a built-in Python library used for interactive debugging. Its name is short for "Python Debugger".

Here's a simple example:

```python
import pdb

def add_numbers(a, b):
    sum = a + b
    pdb.set_trace()  # Debugger entry point
    return sum

print(add_numbers(1, 2))
```

When the program execution hits the `pdb.set_trace()` line, it'll start an interactive debugging session. In this session, you can inspect variables, step over lines, step into functions, and continue execution.

In the debugger, you could type `p sum` to print the value of the `sum` variable, `n` to go to the next line, or `c` to continue execution until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.

2. **Logging:**

Logging is used to record the flow of your program and its state. This is useful for understanding the program's behavior and for debugging.

Here's a simple logging example:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging to log to a file, level=DEBUG, and with a certain format
logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

def add_numbers(a, b):
    logging.debug(f'Adding {a} and {b}')  # Log a debug message
    sum = a + b
    logging.info(f'Sum of {a} and {b} is {sum}')  # Log an info message
    return sum

print(add_numbers(1, 2))
```

In this example, we're using two types of log messages - debug and info. The debug messages are used to give detailed information, typically of use only when diagnosing problems. The info messages confirm that things are working as expected.

This script will create a `app.log` file with the debug and info messages. The `logging.basicConfig()` function is used to configure the logging. There are many other configuration options, including logging to stdout, logging at different levels, and customizing the log message format.

Remember, using `print` statements for debugging and tracking the program flow is not a good practice. It's better to use `pdb` for interactive debugging and `logging` for non-interactive debugging and record keeping.
