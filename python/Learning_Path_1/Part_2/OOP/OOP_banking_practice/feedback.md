Feedback to main.py

Your code looks good and well-organized. You have a clear understanding of how to use classes and how to create relationships between them. The methods within each class are well defined, and it seems like you've implemented all the necessary functionality for a basic banking system.

I have a few suggestions that might improve the readability and reliability of your code:

1. **Avoid direct manipulation of attributes**: In your `Account` class, you directly append the account to the customer's accounts list (`customer.accounts.append(self)`). It would be better to create a method in the `Customer` class for adding accounts. This can provide more control over how accounts are added and it helps encapsulate the behavior within the class.

```python
class Customer:
    ...
    def add_account(self, account):
        self.accounts.append(account)
```

Then in your `Account` class you can use this method:

```python
class Account:
    ...
    def __init__(self, customer, ...):
        ...
        customer.add_account(self)
```

2. **Generating Unique Account Numbers**: Currently, you're using `random.randint(1, 10000000)` to generate unique account numbers. While this will work most of the time, there's no guarantee that you won't get a duplicate number. In a real-world application, you'd likely want to use some sort of counter or other system to ensure that each account number is truly unique.

3. **Error handling in withdrawal**: In the current setup, a user can withdraw more than their account balance. You might want to add some error checking in the `withdraw()` method to prevent this.

4. **Implement proper __str__ or __repr__ methods**: Implementing these methods in your classes will make debugging and logging easier, as you'll be able to print meaningful information about your objects.

5. **Use Exceptions Instead of Print Statements for Errors**: In your `Bank` class, when a customer or account does not exist and you try to remove them, you just print an error message. It would be better to raise an appropriate exception. This makes it clearer that an error has occurred, and allows the calling code to handle the error.

```python
def remove_account(self, account):
    try:
        self.accounts.remove(account)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError(f"This account {account.account_number} does not exist")
```

6. **Documentation**: Add docstrings to your methods and classes to explain what they do. This will make your code easier to understand and maintain.

Overall, you've done a great job on this project. Keep up the good work!
