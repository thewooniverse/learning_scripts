3. Removing customer and accounts
-- closing a customer means doing closing accounts for all acocunts belonging to customer -> and depositing it to another customer;

4. Changing details of customers and sum methods to display amounts!
5. Getpass / password access and controlled access

Forgot password feature + change password feature
-- this entails

6. Datetime of deposit logs / transaction logs into bank's database
7. Graph plot of balances in and out / balances over time from transaction logs both on the user level, and on the bank level.
