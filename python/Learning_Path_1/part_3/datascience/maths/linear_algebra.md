Matrix basics
=========================================================================
A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are fundamental to many areas of mathematics, science, engineering, and data analysis. They have a wide range of applications and can represent various real-world concepts.

### Basics of Matrices:

- **Rows and Columns**: A matrix has rows (horizontal) and columns (vertical), and the numbers in the matrix are called elements. A matrix with \( m \) rows and \( n \) columns is called an \( m \times n \) matrix.

- **Special Matrices**:
  - **Square Matrix**: A matrix with the same number of rows and columns.
  - **Identity Matrix**: A square matrix with 1's on the diagonal and 0's elsewhere.
  - **Diagonal Matrix**: A matrix with non-zero elements along the diagonal and zero elsewhere.
  - **Transpose**: The transpose of a matrix is formed by flipping it over its diagonal.

- **Matrix Arithmetic**: You can add and subtract matrices of the same size, and multiply matrices that have compatible sizes. 

### Real-Life Examples:

1. **Computer Graphics**: In computer graphics, matrices are used to transform shapes and objects. Translation, scaling, and rotation can be represented as matrix operations, allowing for the manipulation of 3D objects on the screen.

2. **Economics**: In economics, matrices can represent relationships between different economies, or different sectors within an economy, showing how changes in one sector might affect others.

3. **Physics**: In physics, matrices can describe rotations and transformations of objects in space. Quantum mechanics also relies heavily on matrix mathematics.

4. **Data Science**: In machine learning and data analysis, matrices are used to hold datasets. Operations on matrices can represent different transformations, manipulations, and algorithms applied to the data.

5. **Transportation**: Matrices can model transportation networks, where elements represent the connection between different locations, such as cities or intersections.

6. **Ecology**: Matrices can model ecological systems, where elements represent interactions between different species in an ecosystem.

### Example of Matrix Arithmetic:

Say you're a teacher, and you have the scores of three tests for two students in a matrix form:

```plaintext
A = [
    [70, 80, 90],
    [60, 75, 85]
]
```

Each row represents a student, and each column represents a test. If you wanted to calculate the total score for each student, you could represent the weight of each test in a vector:

```plaintext
B = [0.3, 0.3, 0.4]
```

Then, multiplying the matrix \( A \) by the vector \( B \) would give you the weighted total score for each student.

Matrices encapsulate a rich structure that can describe many different relationships and transformations. They are a central concept in many areas of science and engineering, and understanding them opens up a vast array of applications and techniques.





=========================================================================
Invertible Matrix
=========================================================================
An invertible matrix, also known as a non-singular or full-rank matrix, is a square matrix that has an inverse. In other words, if \( A \) is an invertible matrix, there exists another matrix \( A^{-1} \) (called the inverse of \( A \)) such that the product of \( A \) and \( A^{-1} \) is the identity matrix:

\[ A \cdot A^{-1} = A^{-1} \cdot A = I \]

The identity matrix \( I \) is a square matrix with ones on its main diagonal and zeros everywhere else.

A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is not zero. If the determinant is zero, the matrix is said to be singular, and it does not have an inverse.

In the context of solving linear equations, an invertible matrix ensures a unique solution to the system. If the matrix is singular, the system may have no solutions or infinitely many solutions, depending on the specific case.

In your given example, the matrix

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9 \end{bmatrix} \]

is singular because its determinant is zero. The rows of this matrix are linearly dependent, meaning one row can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. This property leads to the lack of a unique solution for the corresponding system of linear equations.


=========================================================================
Determinant
=========================================================================
The determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encodes certain properties of the linear transformation described by the matrix.

The determinant of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix

\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} \]

is given by

\[ \text{det}(A) = ad - bc \]

For larger square matrices, the determinant can be computed using various methods, such as the Laplace expansion, which expresses the determinant as a sum of \( n \) terms, each of which is the product of an entry from the matrix, a co-factor, and a sign (\(+\) or \(-\)).

The determinant has several important properties:

1. **Geometrical Interpretation**: In \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) and \( \mathbb{R}^3 \), the absolute value of the determinant gives the area and volume of the parallelogram and parallelepiped formed by the column vectors of the matrix, respectively.
2. **Effect on Linear Transformations**: It describes how area or volume changes under the linear transformation represented by the matrix. If the determinant is zero, it collapses the space into a lower dimension.
3. **Existence of Inverse**: A square matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant is not zero.
4. **Solving Linear Equations**: The determinant is used in Cramer's Rule, a way to solve a system of linear equations.
5. **Product Property**: The determinant of a product of matrices is equal to the product of their determinants: \(\text{det}(AB) = \text{det}(A) \cdot \text{det}(B)\).

The determinant is a critical concept in linear algebra and has applications in various fields like physics, engineering, and economics.


=========================================================================
Scalar Values
=========================================================================
A scalar value is a single numerical value, as opposed to a vector or a matrix, which contains multiple numerical values. In mathematical terms, scalars are elements of a field, often the real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\) or complex numbers \(\mathbb{C}\).

In the context of physics and engineering, scalars are quantities that are fully described by a magnitude alone. For example, temperature, mass, and energy are scalar quantities.

In contrast, vectors have both magnitude and direction, and matrices have multiple rows and columns of values. Scalars can be thought of as \(1 \times 1\) matrices or as vectors with a single component.

Here are some operations that you might perform with scalars:

- **Multiplication with a Vector**: Multiplying a vector by a scalar scales its length without changing its direction.
- **Multiplication with a Matrix**: Multiplying a matrix by a scalar multiplies every element of the matrix by that scalar.
- **Addition and Subtraction**: Scalars can be added and subtracted from each other just like ordinary numbers.

So in summary, a scalar value is just a single numerical value, and it can interact in simple ways with more complex mathematical structures like vectors and matrices.
