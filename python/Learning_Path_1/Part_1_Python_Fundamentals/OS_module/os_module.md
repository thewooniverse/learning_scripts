The `os` module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It comes under Python's standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system, starting or killing processes, reading environment variables, and so forth.

Here is a brief overview of some common use cases:

1. **Working with Directories**:
   - `os.mkdir('directory_name')`: This creates a new directory with the name 'directory_name'.
   - `os.chdir('directory_name')`: This changes the current working directory to 'directory_name'.
   - `os.getcwd()`: This returns the current working directory.
   - `os.rmdir('directory_name')`: This removes the directory named 'directory_name' (note that the directory needs to be empty).

2. **Working with Files**:
   - `os.rename('old_filename', 'new_filename')`: This renames a file from 'old_filename' to 'new_filename'.
   - `os.remove('filename')`: This removes the file 'filename'.
  
3. **Fetching Information**:
   - `os.listdir('directory_name')`: This returns a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by 'directory_name'.
   - `os.path.exists('path')`: This checks if a path or file exists.
   - `os.path.getsize('filename')`: This gets the size of the file.

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - `os.environ`: It's a mapping object representing the string environment. For example, `os.environ['HOME']` would return the home directory.

5. **System Information**:
   - `os.cpu_count()`: Returns the number of CPUs in the system.

Here's an example of how you might use some of these functions:

```python
import os

# print the current working directory
print(os.getcwd())

# create a new directory
os.mkdir('new_directory')

# verify that the new directory exists
print(os.path.exists('new_directory'))  # prints: True

# change the current working directory
os.chdir('new_directory')

# print the current working directory
print(os.getcwd())  # prints: /full/path/to/new_directory

# go back to the original directory
os.chdir('..')

# remove the new directory
os.rmdir('new_directory')

# verify that the new directory no longer exists
print(os.path.exists('new_directory'))  # prints: False
```

Remember to replace `'new_directory'` with your actual paths, and remember that these operations can affect your file system, so use them with care.

Note: Some functions from `os` module can behave differently on different operating systems due to the nature of the OS itself. For more comprehensive manipulation of paths, use the `os.path` module along with `os`.
