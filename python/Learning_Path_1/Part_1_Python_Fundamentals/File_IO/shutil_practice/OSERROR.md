The error `OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system` indicates that Python is unable to write to the specified path. This could be because the path doesn't exist, or because Python doesn't have permission to write to that path.

In your case, the error message `/copy.py` suggests that you're trying to write to the root directory, which Python might not have permission to do, or it might not be possible depending on your system's permissions.

When specifying the target path in `shutil.copyfile(original, target)`, you should specify a complete path, including the directory and the filename, to a location where Python has write permissions. 

For example, if you want to create `copy.py` in your current directory, the target path should be something like `./copy.py`.

Here's a corrected example:

```python
import shutil

# specify the original file and destination file path
original = './original.py'
target = './copy.py'

# copy the file
shutil.copyfile(original, target)
```

This script will look for `original.py` in the current directory (the same directory where this script is run), and will create a copy named `copy.py` in the same directory.

Remember to replace `'./original.py'` and `'./copy.py'` with your actual paths. If the file paths are not in the same directory as your Python script, you should provide the full file path.
