`__pycache__` is a directory that Python creates in your project directories when you run a Python program. This directory contains bytecode compiled versions of the Python source files you've imported in your program.

Python source code files have the extension `.py`. When you run a Python program, the interpreter parses this source code, compiles it to bytecode (which is a low-level platform-independent representation of the source code), and then runs the bytecode.

Bytecode is stored in files with the extension `.pyc` which are located in the `__pycache__` directory. This compilation step allows Python to skip parsing the source code into bytecode when the same module is imported and run again, which can speed up program execution. 

The next time you run your program, Python checks the timestamp on the source code file against the timestamp on the compiled file in `__pycache__`. If the source code hasn't changed, Python uses the already compiled file from `__pycache__`. If the source code has changed, Python recompiles it and replaces the old compiled file in `__pycache__` with the new one.

You might also notice that these `.pyc` files in `__pycache__` have a version number in their name, like `module.cpython-36.pyc`. This is because different Python versions might produce different bytecode, so Python stores a compiled file for each version that you run.

In general, you don't need to worry about the `__pycache__` directory or the `.pyc` files. They're an implementation detail of how Python works and aren't something you typically need to manage or manipulate. You can safely ignore this directory or even add it to your `.gitignore` file if you're using a version control system like Git.
