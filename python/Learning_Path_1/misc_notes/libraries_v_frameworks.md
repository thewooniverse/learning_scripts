At a high level, both frameworks and libraries are reusable code written by someone else that you can use to perform common tasks. However, the difference between the two lies in control flow, or in other words, who is in charge of the program's control flow.

**Library:**

A library is a collection of modules and functions that a programmer can call to perform a specific task. The library provides a way to achieve a behavior without writing all the code yourself. When you're using a library, you're in control. You decide when to call the library and which parts of it to use. For example, if you need to read and write JSON data in your program, you might use Python's `json` library, calling its functions when necessary.

**Framework:**

A framework, on the other hand, is more encompassing: it not only provides the code to complete certain tasks, but also provides a 'framework' (hence the name) in which you build your application. The framework is in control and provides specific places for you to plug in your code. It dictates the program flow, having built-in mechanisms for things like handling HTTP requests, managing sessions, etc. When you're using a framework, it's the framework that calls your code. An example is Django or Flask in Python, which are web application frameworks.

A common way to think about the difference is through the "Inversion of Control" principle, sometimes called the "Hollywood Principle": "Don't call us, we'll call you." When you're using a library, you're calling it. When you're using a framework, it's calling you (your code).

It's also important to note that a framework typically includes one or more libraries to perform common tasks. However, not all libraries are part of frameworks. Many libraries can be, and are, used independently.
