### NetworkX
NetworkX is a popular Python library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks of nodes and edges. You can also draw a network graph using NetworkX and Matplotlib together.

Here's a simple example:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a graph object
G = nx.Graph()

# Add edges (implicitly adds nodes)
G.add_edge("Account A", "Account B")
G.add_edge("Account A", "Account C")
G.add_edge("Account C", "Account D")

# Draw the graph
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_color="lightblue", font_weight="bold", node_size=700, font_size=18)
plt.show()
```

In the above example, the accounts A, B, C, and D are the nodes, and the money transferred between them is represented as the edges. You can customize the graph further to show edge weights (i.e., the amount transferred), directed edges (i.e., the direction of transfer), etc.

### Graph-tool

Graph-tool is another Python library for manipulation and statistical analysis of graphs, which is somewhat faster than NetworkX but has a steeper learning curve.

### PyGraphviz

PyGraphviz is more suitable for drawing complex graph structures. It provides more layout algorithms than NetworkX and is based on the Graphviz graph drawing software.

### Other Libraries

Other JavaScript libraries like D3.js are popular for creating dynamic and interactive network graphs, which you can embed in a web application. Python libraries like Dash could also serve for this purpose, offering a bridge between Python and front-end technologies like D3.js.

In summary, for specifically drawing network or tree structures, NetworkX and similar libraries would be more appropriate than Matplotlib or Seaborn.
