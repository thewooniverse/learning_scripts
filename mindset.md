**No Rush**
You have your clear north star goal of becoming a really good engineer.
That is not going anywhere, daily, you put in the time to learn and get better and learn better ways to do things.
So there is no rush, your goals are not going anywhere.



**Assume stupidity**
I am not exceptionally talented or gifted with mathematics or algorithms, nor do I have a really strong memory.
I will most likely need to re-learn things a few times until they stick, and often forget things that I have just learnt.
This is all normal.

Remove all notion of urgency, and all frustration from forgetting anythign at all.
For re-learning things will bolster the learning once again in your mind, and whatever you need to remember will become sticky through repetition.

Have patience, assume humility and put in the hard work and hours.
Forget many times, re-learn many times.

**Problem solving and solution oriented mindset**
There is a solution to the problem out there, I just need to find it.
I just need to learn how to ask the question properly, or to look in the right places.
I can solve any problem.

The computer is never wrong.
