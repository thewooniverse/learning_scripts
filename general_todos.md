## 1. Continue learning + mastering Dat Scienc Projects
- Data Wars projects / tasks daily

### CAPSTONE PROJECT x Work:
Full automation of TallyUP's cashout auditing process
- Pandas + Numpy usage to analyze and break down data
- Usage of APIs to download / upload different gameplay history + audit and upload data


## 2. Continue bot development project
Telegram Bots:
- Peepo price bot -> forces me to learn AWS
- GPT based Learning + Langchain personal asisstant bot

### CAPSTONE PROJECT x Work:
Full langchain based ZenDesk bot to automate zendesk requests


## 3. Continue learning advanced python + AWS and DevOps

### CAPSTONE PROJECT x Work:
hifi farm with private repository :D


===== After this, I continue to learn and build matsery in python, automating further parts of TallyUP and for personal life =====
I then go into do a coding bootcamp to learn further on Full Stack:
=> JavaScript based fullstack web dev (Codesmith / Codeworks)
==> Recurse Center
===> Consensys / Alchemy Web3 developer workshop


Then, I am pretty much free to fly :D


CS50 and Brilliant.org to improve basic algorithmic thinking and problem solving.
Python Roadmap.sh to learn about decorators and other python-only syntaxes and tricks.



















Telegram bots:

GPT Bot - I can have a GPT bot that interacts with Google search as well or discuss / discourse
Investment advisory bot
Learning Bot


There's a lot of different directions that the coding stuff can take me money or useful projects.

For learning, I can write bots and scripts to automate my work at TallyUP.
I can also write telegram bots that help me to learn with spaced repetition.

For crypto / profitability I can write a influencer army bot and market it to people. (this could be an extremely profitable business).
I could also write a telegram sniping bot or investment advisory bot -> that translates into a referral link biz model.
I could also just write straight up sybil bots.

================================
Current self study track for scripting
================================
1. Leaderboard game for Castle Explorer game (complete)
2. OOP + Error handling lessons + exercises -> apply to castle explorer game
--> Banking system project (complete)

Next up (HERE):
- V3 Banking project (3-5 days probably to work on this fully)
-- pickle, encryption, UI, onboarding etc...

- Castle Explorer game upgrade --> daily like an hour or so on it
-- Add wait times and "saving" gameplay history
-- Add probabalistic outcomes for encounters
-- Add saving and loading games using pickle
-- Feature for starting new game, saving or loading an existing game.

3. Regex lessons
--> Scraper / Extractors, phonebook, word finder / quiz module (for Castle explorer game)
--> extractor script
--> File organizer script
--> telephone book


4. Selenium web scraping, email / eth address scraper - Etherscan scraper
--> Etherscan extractor and scraper / transactions parser potentially using other APIs to build telegram bots
----> data science related stuff;



5. Data Science projects + scraping projects using Beautiful Soup / Selenium introductions.
--> Apply data science / pandas data frames to banking project and other simple data analysis projects

6. TallyUP Scripts to enhance workflow / automate things...
7. Telegram bots for Left Curve Ninjas ===>

NEW PROJECT:
CHAT GPT INTEGRATION for Telegram bots


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n809nd4Zu4
^ developing a chrome extension.


Unit testing, devops etc...

-- TU scripts
1. Automated surge event scheduling
2. Automated surge notification scheduling (using Firebase API)
3. Starting to see source code / codebase for TallyUP and understanding the code / refactoring and building its own API for backend communications and integrations
4. KongBot V3
5. Automated auditing
Then move onto AutoGPT / LangChain stuff to build full suite of capable AI support agents.
Once per day script, timed, running on VPS to do cron jobs on admin backend.
----- continue on this path as you learn full stack web dev.

================================
From this point above, I am just continuously working on TallyUP scripts and enhancing personal workflow and working on fun projects myself
At this point, I will begin my journey into JavaScript and the CodeSmiths syllabus
================================
CodeSmiths Full Stack development projects:

- Left Curve Ninjas website building
- Additional Telegram bot building


================================





Then solidity and AI / ML

https://huggingface.co/
Langchain
roadmap.sh

ALWAYS more things to learn.





====User
Fantastic! Python is a powerful, versatile language that's great for beginners and has the depth to handle advanced programming tasks as well. Here's a proposed learning path:

**Part 1: Python Fundamentals**

- **Topics:**
  - Python setup and installation
  - Variables, data types, and operators
  - Control flow: loops and conditional statements
  - Basic data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
  - Functions and modules
  - File I/O operations

- **Project:**
  - Create a text-based adventure game where players make decisions through input prompts. For example, the game could involve exploring a castle, where each room presents a different situation and set of choices.

**Part 2: Intermediate Python**

- **Topics:**
  - Advanced data structures: stacks, queues, and trees
  - Object-oriented programming: classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism
  - Exception handling and debugging
  - Working with external libraries
  - Basic regular expressions for pattern matching

- **Project:**
  - Build a simple command-line address book application. Users should be able to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts, with the contact information stored in a file that persists between program runs.

**Part 3: Python for Data Science**

- **Topics:**
  - Introduction to NumPy and Pandas
  - Data cleaning and transformation
  - Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
  - Basic statistical analysis

- **Project:**
  - Analyze a dataset of your choice (e.g., from Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository). Clean the data, explore it with different visualizations, and present your findings in a clear, organized way.

**Part 4: Advanced Python**

- **Topics:**
  - Multithreading and multiprocessing
  - Network programming (sockets, HTTP requests)
  - Database interaction with SQLite or PostgreSQL
  - Web scraping with Beautiful Soup
  - Testing and test-driven development

- **Project:**
  - Develop a multi-threaded web scraper that retrieves and stores information from a website. Respect the site's terms of service and the legality of web scraping in your jurisdiction.

**Part 5: Python for Web Development**

- **Topics:**
  - Introduction to Flask or Django
  - Routing, templates, and forms
  - User authentication
  - Database integration with SQLAlchemy or Django's ORM
  - Deploying Python web applications

- **Project:**
  - Build and deploy a web application. This could be a personal blog, a portfolio, or a simple social network. Include user authentication and database-driven dynamic content.

Throughout each part of this learning path, always focus on writing clean, readable code and incorporating Python's "Zen" â€” principles like simplicity, clarity, and readability count. Enjoy your Python learning journey!
