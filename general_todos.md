1. Leaderboard game for Castle Explorer game (complete)
2. OOP + Error handling lessons + exercises -> apply to castle explorer game
--> Banking system project (complete)

Next up (HERE):
- V2 Banking project (3-5 days probably to work on this fully)
-- Sqlite, encryption, UI, onboarding etc...
- Castle Explorer game upgrade
-- Add wait times and "saving" gameplay history
-- Add probabalistic outcomes for encounters
-- Add saving and loading games using pickle
-- Feature for starting new game, or loading an existing game.

All of this is really fun to build, and then from there I can learn some more stuff around regex.


Then move onto 3
3. Regex lessons
--> Scraper / Extractors, phonebook, word finder / quiz module (for Castle explorer game)
--> extractor script

4. Selenium web scraping, email / eth address scraper
--> Etherscan extractor and scraper / transactions parser potentially using other APIs to build telegram bots

5. Data Science projects + scraping projects using Beautiful Soup / Selenium introductions.
--> Apply data science / pandas data frames to banking project and other simple data analysis projects

6. TallyUP Scripts to enhance workflow / automate things...

Unit testing, devops etc...

-- TU scripts
1. Automated surge event scheduling
2. Automated surge notification scheduling (using Firebase API)
3. Starting to see source code / codebase for TallyUP and understanding the code / refactoring and building its own API for backend communications and integrations
4. KongBot V3
5. Automated auditing
Then move onto AutoGPT / LangChain stuff to build full suite of capable AI support agents.
Once per day script, timed, running on VPS to do cron jobs on admin backend.
----- continue on this path as you learn full stack web dev.
