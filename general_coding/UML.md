Yes, UML (Unified Modeling Language) is still used in certain environments and can be a valuable tool for visualizing system architecture, class relationships, workflows, and more. However, its usage varies widely depending on the team, the project, the development methodology, and other factors.

While some teams may create detailed UML diagrams for every component of a system before beginning development (particularly in waterfall environments), others may only use UML diagrams for high-level architecture or not use them at all (particularly in Agile environments).

Some modern best practices for modeling software architecture include:

1. **Iterative Modeling**: Architecture is not a one-time thing that is done at the beginning of a project and then forgotten about. Instead, architecture is best approached as an iterative process that evolves over time as requirements change and as the team learns more about the problem and the solution.

2. **Use the Right Tools**: While UML can be a valuable tool for certain types of diagrams, it's not always the best tool for every situation. There are many other tools and notations available that may be better suited to the task at hand. Some popular modern tools for architecture modeling include ArchiMate, BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), and even simple whiteboard diagrams.

3. **Understand and Communicate Trade-Offs**: Every architectural decision involves trade-offs, and a key part of modern architecture modeling is understanding those trade-offs and communicating them effectively to stakeholders.

4. **Keep It Simple**: While it's possible to create incredibly detailed and complex architecture models, this often isn't the most effective approach. Instead, strive to keep your architecture models as simple and understandable as possible. This helps to ensure that they can be effectively used as a communication tool and that they remain maintainable as the system evolves.

5. **Documentation**: Keeping an updated document that explains the architectural decisions and the reasoning behind them can be very useful for both the present team and any future developers who might work on the project.

6. **Code as a Source of Truth**: In Agile and DevOps environments, the source code (along with automated tests, infrastructure as code, etc.) is often treated as the single source of truth. The living system and its codebase become more important than any out-of-date diagrams. Some architectures can be directly extracted from the codebase using tools. This doesn't mean that diagrams and documents aren't used, but they are often seen as supplementary to the code.

Remember, the main goal of architecture modeling should be to aid understanding and communication about the system. Therefore, use the tools and methodologies that best achieve that goal for your specific project and team.
