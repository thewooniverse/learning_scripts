(in no particular order)

1. Writing Clean Code:

2. Learning via video tutorials
Video tutorials / twitch live coding sessions are a great way for you to passively learn.
You get to see other, often more experience coders using modules or libraries you don't yet understand in practice.
You get inspirations, insight into best practices and usage of a new module or use case that you are interested.

For example;

Telegram bot tutorial teaches me how to use telebot library and use APIs to build a telegram bot.

Its a great format when you don't want to code and are just looking for inspiration, or while eating or learning how to use a new tool or build toward a new usecase!

3. Developing and coding - planning and writing;

It is really important to have a clear sturcutre as to what is the goal, what needs to be developed specifically;
And what software solution - architecture, tools, libraries, algorithms will lead to the desired features is really important.
It also is crucial that I do this, so that I do not feel lost during the process of coding.
> As often times, I find myself just developing away at additional features and getting lost in the code / process of doing so.
> This breeds an extent of anxiety in my mind because I am not exactly sure what I am building towards.

tldr; spend as much time thinking of the use case / features that need to be developed, and the solutions that you desire and plan those out before beginning to code.
