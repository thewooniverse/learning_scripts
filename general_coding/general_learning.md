1. Writing Clean Code:

2. Learning via video tutorials
Video tutorials / twitch live coding sessions are a great way for you to passively learn.
You get to see other, often more experience coders using modules or libraries you don't yet understand in practice.
You get inspirations, insight into best practices and usage of a new module or use case that you are interested.

For example;

Telegram bot tutorial teaches me how to use telebot library and use APIs to build a telegram bot.

Its a great format when you don't want to code and are just looking for inspiration, or while eating or learning how to use a new tool or build toward a new usecase!

3. Developing and coding - planning and writing;

It is really important to have a clear sturcutre as to what is the goal, what needs to be developed specifically;
And what software solution - architecture, tools, libraries, algorithms will lead to the desired features is really important.
It also is crucial that I do this, so that I do not feel lost during the process of coding.
> As often times, I find myself just developing away at additional features and getting lost in the code / process of doing so.
> This breeds an extent of anxiety in my mind because I am not exactly sure what I am building towards.

tldr; spend as much time thinking of the use case / features that need to be developed, and the solutions that you desire and plan those out before beginning to code.


4. Refactoring
Refactoring code means to modify and restructure existing source code without changing its external behavior. The primary goal of refactoring is to improve the non-functional attributes of the software, making it easier to comprehend, reducing its complexity, and increasing its maintainability. 

Here's a deeper dive into what refactoring entails:

1. **Improving Code Readability**: Over time, code can become cluttered and hard to read. Refactoring can involve renaming variables, functions, or classes to more descriptive names, or breaking down large functions into smaller, more understandable parts.

2. **Reducing Complexity**: A piece of code might be written in a hurry and work fine, but it might be more convoluted than necessary. Refactoring can help in reducing this complexity.

3. **Eliminating Redundant or Dead Code**: As software evolves, certain sections of code may become obsolete or redundant. Refactoring helps identify and remove such code.

4. **Improving Performance**: While the primary goal of refactoring is to make the code more readable and maintainable, in some cases, it can also result in performance improvements.

5. **Facilitating Extensibility**: As requirements change, you might find that your current code structure is not conducive to adding new features. Refactoring can help restructure the code in a way that makes it easier to incorporate new requirements.

6. **Correcting Poor Design Choices**: Over time, as more is learned about the problem domain, you might realize that some of the original design decisions were not ideal. Refactoring allows for these design decisions to be revisited and revised.

7. **Making Code More Testable**: Refactoring can help break down code in such a way that it becomes easier to write unit tests for it. 

Refactoring requires a good set of tests to be in place. Since refactoring means changing code without modifying behavior, having tests ensures that you haven't inadvertently introduced bugs. 

Tools like linters, formatters, and static analyzers can also aid in the refactoring process, as they can point out potential issues in code quality or style that can be targets for refactoring.

In summary, refactoring is a vital practice in the software development process, ensuring that code remains clean, maintainable, and efficient. It's often said that code is "read much more often than it's written," making the clarity achieved through refactoring crucial.
