https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html
The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is a toolkit that improves the developer experience of building and running serverless applications on AWS. AWS SAM consists of two primary parts:

- AWS SAM template specification – An open-source framework that you can use to define your serverless application infrastructure on AWS.

- AWS SAM command line interface (AWS SAM CLI) – A command line tool that you can use with AWS SAM templates and supported third-party integrations to build and run your serverless applications.

# Event Driven Architecture
A serverless application consists of individual AWS services, such as AWS Lambda for compute and Amazon DynamoDB for database management, that each perform a specialized role. These services are then loosely integrated with each other through an event-driven architecture. To learn more about event-driven architecture, see What is an Event-Driven Architecture?.
