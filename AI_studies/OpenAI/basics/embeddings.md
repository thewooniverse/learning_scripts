## What are embeddings?
OpenAIâ€™s text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings. 
Embeddings are commonly used for:

- Search (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
- Clustering (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
- Recommendations (where items with related text strings are recommended)
- Anomaly detection (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
- Diversity measurement (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
- Classification (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)

An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.

## How to get embeddings
To get an embedding, send your text string to the embeddings API endpoint along with the embedding model ID (text-embedding-ada-002). The response will contain an embedding, which you can extract, save, and use. (examples / exercises in embeddings.py)
