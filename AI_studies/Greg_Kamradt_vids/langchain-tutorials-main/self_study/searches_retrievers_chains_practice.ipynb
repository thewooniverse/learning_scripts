       " Document(page_content='------------------------------------------------------------\\nOVERIVEW:\\n--------------------\\nThe `thefuzz` library is a Python library that provides fuzzy string matching and similarity functions. It is commonly used for tasks such as string matching, searching, and deduplication. The library offers various algorithms and methods to calculate the similarity between strings, allowing users to find matches even when there are slight differences or variations in the strings.\\n\\nSome common use cases of the `thefuzz` library include:\\n\\n1. Search and retrieval: The library can be used to search for similar strings in a large dataset. This is useful in applications like search engines, autocomplete suggestions, and data deduplication.\\n\\n2. Data cleaning and preprocessing: The library can help in cleaning and preprocessing text data by identifying and handling variations and inconsistencies in strings. This is useful in tasks like data normalization, record linkage, and data quality improvement.\\n\\n3. Natural language processing: The library can be applied in natural language processing tasks such as text classification, document clustering, and text similarity calculations.\\n\\n4. Spell checking and correction: The library\\'s fuzzy matching algorithms can be used to create spell checkers and correct misspelled words by finding the most similar words in a dictionary.\\n\\nOverall, the `thefuzz` library provides a powerful set of tools for working with fuzzy string matching and similarity calculations, making it a valuable resource for various text processing and analysis tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nEXAMPLES:\\n--------------------\\nThe `thefuzz` library is primarily used for tasks involving string matching and similarity calculations. Here are some of its key use cases:\\n\\n1. Search and retrieval: It can be used to search for similar strings in large datasets. This is particularly valuable in applications such as search engines, where it can help enhance search results by finding matches even with slight differences in the input, or in autocomplete suggestions, where it can suggest the most relevant options based on partial input.\\n\\n2. Data cleaning and preprocessing: `thefuzz` can be useful in cleaning and preprocessing text data by identifying and handling variations and inconsistencies in strings. For example, it can be used in data normalization to make sure that different representations of the same data (like \"St.\" and \"Street\") are treated as equal, or in record linkage to connect records that refer to the same entity but have slight differences in their string representations.\\n\\n3. Natural language processing: The library can be applied in various natural language processing tasks. For instance, in text classification or document clustering, it can calculate the similarity between different texts, helping to group similar documents together. \\n\\n4. Spell checking and correction: The fuzzy matching algorithms of `thefuzz` can be used to develop spell checkers.

Make sure to apply what you learn in real-world scenarios and continuously challenge yourself with new and complex matching tasks. Good luck on your journey to mastering TheFuzz!\\n\\n\\n--------------------\\nSure! Here\\'s some information and examples to help you get started with Milestone 1:\\n\\n1. Understand the purpose and benefits of fuzzy string matching:\\n   - Fuzzy string matching is a technique used to compare strings and determine their similarity, even if they are not an exact match.\\n   - It is useful in various applications such as data cleaning, text search, record linkage, and spell checking.\\n   - The main benefit of fuzzy string matching is that it allows for flexible matching, taking into account differences in spelling, punctuation, and word order.\\n\\n2. Write a simple program using TheFuzz to perform fuzzy string matching:\\n   - TheFuzz is a Python package that provides easy-to-use functions for fuzzy string matching.\\n   - To get started, you need to install TheFuzz using pip. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:\\n     ```\\n     pip install thefuzz\\n     ```\\n   - Once TheFuzz is installed, you can import it and use its functions in your Python program.\\n   - Here\\'s an example of a simple program that uses TheFuzz to perform fuzzy string matching using the `fuzz.ratio()` function:\\n     ```python\\n     from thefuzz import fuzz\\n\\n     string1 = \"apple\"\\n     string2 = \"aple\"', metadata={'source': '/Users/woo/Desktop/studies/learning_scripts/AI_studies/Greg_Kamradt_vids/langchain-tutorials-main/data/thefuzz/Learning_Path.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='string1 = \"apple\"\\n     string2 = \"aple\"\\n\\n     similarity = fuzz.ratio(string1, string2)\\n     print(similarity)  # Output: 91\\n     ```\\n     In this example, the `fuzz.ratio()` function is used to compare the similarity between \"apple\" and \"aple\". The output is a similarity score of 91, indicating a high degree of similarity between the two strings.\\n\\n   - You can explore other functions provided by TheFuzz, such as `fuzz.partial_ratio()`, `fuzz.token_sort_ratio()`, `fuzz.token_set_ratio()`, and `process.extract()` for more advanced fuzzy string matching techniques.\\n\\nI hope this helps you get started with Milestone 1! Let me know if you have any further questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n1. Learn about the different types of ratio matching provided by TheFuzz, such as Simple Ratio and Partial Ratio:\\n   - TheFuzz provides several ratio matching functions, including:\\n     - `fuzz.ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings. It compares the entire strings and returns a value between 0 and 100, where 100 means the strings are an exact match.\\n     - `fuzz.partial_ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings, but only considers a subset of the shorter string. This is useful when you want to match a portion of one string with another.\\n     - `fuzz.token_sort_ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings, but first tokenizes the strings and sorts the tokens alphabetically. This is useful when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order.\\n     - `fuzz.token_set_ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings, but first tokenizes the strings and creates a set of unique tokens. This is useful when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order and with additional words.\\n\\n2. Understand the differences between these ratios and when to use each one:\\n   - Simple Ratio: Use this when you want to compare two strings and get a general sense of their similarity. It compares the entire strings and doesn\\'t consider the order or presence of specific words.\\n   - Partial Ratio: Use this when you want to match a portion of one string with another. It only considers a subset of the shorter string, making it useful for fuzzy matching.\\n   - Token Sort Ratio: Use this when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order. It tokenizes the strings, sorts the tokens alphabetically, and then calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio.\\n   - Token Set Ratio: Use this when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order and with additional words. It tokenizes the strings, creates a set of unique tokens, and then calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio.\\n\\n3. Practice using ratio matching functions with different examples and datasets:\\n   - You can use the ratio matching functions provided by TheFuzz to compare strings in various scenarios. For example:\\n     - Comparing product names in an e-commerce website to suggest alternative products to customers.\\n     - Matching customer names in a CRM system to detect potential duplicates.\\n     - Finding similar documents in a document management system.', metadata={'source': '/Users/woo/Desktop/studies/learning_scripts/AI_studies/Greg_Kamradt_vids/langchain-tutorials-main/data/thefuzz/Learning_Path.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"4. Explore the limitations and edge cases of ratio matching:\\n   - Ratio matching is a powerful technique for fuzzy string matching, but it has its limitations. Some common limitations include:\\n     - Sensitivity to word order: Simple Ratio does not consider the order of words, which can lead to incorrect matches in some cases.\\n     - Sensitivity to word variations: Ratio matching may not handle word variations well, such as plurals or different verb tenses.\\n     - Sensitivity to input length: Partial Ratio may not produce accurate results if the subset of the shorter string is too small or if the strings are significantly different in length.\\n     - Performance: Ratio matching can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.

This\\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\\nFoundation\\'s software and to any other program whose authors commit to\\nusing it.

You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\\nrights.\\n\\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\\n\\n  Also, for each author\\'s protection and ours, we want to make certain\\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\\nauthors\\' reputations.\\n\\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\\npatent must be licensed for everyone\\'s free use or not licensed at all.\\n\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\nmodification follow.\\n\\x0c\\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\\n\\n  0.

For an executable work, complete source\\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\\nitself accompanies the executable.\\n\\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\\n\\x0c\\n  4.

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.

Therefore, by\\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\\nthe Program or works based on it.\\n\\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\\nthese terms and conditions.

If you cannot\\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\", metadata={'source': '/Users/woo/Desktop/studies/learning_scripts/AI_studies/Greg_Kamradt_vids/langchain-tutorials-main/data/thefuzz/LICENSE.txt'}),\n",

[iddober]\\n\\n- Add reference to C# port. [ericcoleman]\\n\\n- Chore: remove license header from files. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]\\n\\n  The files should all inherit the projects license.\\n\\n\\n- Fix README title style. [Thomas Grainger]\\n\\n- Add readme check. [Thomas Grainger]\\n\\n  install docutils and Pygments\\n\\n\\n- Cache pip. [Thomas Grainger]\\n\\n- Upgrade pip/setuptools for hypothesis. [Thomas Grainger]\\n\\n- Feat: drop py26 and py33 support from tox. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]\\n\\n- Feat: drop support for 2.6 in test_thefuzz.py. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]\\n\\n- Feat: drop reference to 2.4 from readme. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]\\n\\n- Feat: drop py2.6 and py3.3 classifiers. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]\\n\\n- Feat: drop 2.6 and 3.3 support. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]\\n\\n  These are no longer supported. Please upgrade your python version if you are using either version.\\n\\n- Fuzz: _token_sort: check for equivalence. [Ralf Ramsauer]\\n\\n  If we don't have to full_process the strings, we can safely assume to\\n  return 100 in case both candidates equal.\\n\\n  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>\\n\\n\\n- Test: add more test cases. [Ralf Ramsauer]\\n\\n  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>\\n\\n\\n- Utils: add and use check_for_equivalence decorator. [Ralf Ramsauer]\\n\\n  And decorate basic scoring functions.\\n\\n  The check_for_equivalence decorator MUST be used after the\\n  check_for_none decorator, as otherwise ratio(None, None) will get a\\n  score of 100.\\n\\n  This fixes the first part of the recently introduced changes in the test\\n  set.\\n\\n  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>\\n\\n\\n- Tests: add some corner cases. [Ralf Ramsauer]\\n\\n  '' and '' are equal, so are '{' and '{'. Test if thefuzz gives them a\\n  score of 100.\\n\\n  For the moment, this patch breaks tests, fixes in thefuzz follow.\\n\\n  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>\\n\\n\\n- Utils: remove superfluous check. [Ralf Ramsauer]\\n\\n  Decorators make sure that only non None-values are passed. We can safely\\n  assume that None will never get here.\\n\\n  Other than that, None's shouldn't simply be ignored and erroneously\\n  changed to empty strings. Better let users fail.\\n\\n  This commit doesn't break any tests.\\n\\n  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>\\n\\n\\n- README: add missing requirements. [Ralf Ramsauer]\\n\\n  pycodestyle and hypothesis are required for automatic testing. Add them\\n  to README's requirement section.\\n\\n  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>\\n\\n\\n- Remove empty document.

[Nathan\\n  Typanski]\\n\\n  Previously, process.extract expected lists or dictionaries, and tested\\n  this with isinstance() calls.

Make sure to apply what you learn in real-world scenarios and continuously challenge yourself with new and complex matching tasks. Good luck on your journey to mastering TheFuzz!\\n\\n\\n--------------------\\nSure! Here\\'s some information and examples to help you get started with Milestone 1:\\n\\n1. Understand the purpose and benefits of fuzzy string matching:\\n   - Fuzzy string matching is a technique used to compare strings and determine their similarity, even if they are not an exact match.\\n   - It is useful in various applications such as data cleaning, text search, record linkage, and spell checking.\\n   - The main benefit of fuzzy string matching is that it allows for flexible matching, taking into account differences in spelling, punctuation, and word order.\\n\\n2. Write a simple program using TheFuzz to perform fuzzy string matching:\\n   - TheFuzz is a Python package that provides easy-to-use functions for fuzzy string matching.\\n   - To get started, you need to install TheFuzz using pip. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:\\n     ```\\n     pip install thefuzz\\n     ```\\n   - Once TheFuzz is installed, you can import it and use its functions in your Python program.\\n   - Here\\'s an example of a simple program that uses TheFuzz to perform fuzzy string matching using the `fuzz.ratio()` function:\\n     ```python\\n     from thefuzz import fuzz\\n\\n     string1 = \"apple\"\\n     string2 = \"aple\"', metadata={'source': '/Users/woo/Desktop/studies/learning_scripts/AI_studies/Greg_Kamradt_vids/langchain-tutorials-main/data/thefuzz/.ipynb_checkpoints/Learning_Path-checkpoint.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='string1 = \"apple\"\\n     string2 = \"aple\"\\n\\n     similarity = fuzz.ratio(string1, string2)\\n     print(similarity)  # Output: 91\\n     ```\\n     In this example, the `fuzz.ratio()` function is used to compare the similarity between \"apple\" and \"aple\". The output is a similarity score of 91, indicating a high degree of similarity between the two strings.\\n\\n   - You can explore other functions provided by TheFuzz, such as `fuzz.partial_ratio()`, `fuzz.token_sort_ratio()`, `fuzz.token_set_ratio()`, and `process.extract()` for more advanced fuzzy string matching techniques.\\n\\nI hope this helps you get started with Milestone 1! Let me know if you have any further questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n1. Learn about the different types of ratio matching provided by TheFuzz, such as Simple Ratio and Partial Ratio:\\n   - TheFuzz provides several ratio matching functions, including:\\n     - `fuzz.ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings. It compares the entire strings and returns a value between 0 and 100, where 100 means the strings are an exact match.\\n     - `fuzz.partial_ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings, but only considers a subset of the shorter string. This is useful when you want to match a portion of one string with another.\\n     - `fuzz.token_sort_ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings, but first tokenizes the strings and sorts the tokens alphabetically. This is useful when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order.\\n     - `fuzz.token_set_ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings, but first tokenizes the strings and creates a set of unique tokens. This is useful when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order and with additional words.\\n\\n2. Understand the differences between these ratios and when to use each one:\\n   - Simple Ratio: Use this when you want to compare two strings and get a general sense of their similarity. It compares the entire strings and doesn\\'t consider the order or presence of specific words.\\n   - Partial Ratio: Use this when you want to match a portion of one string with another. It only considers a subset of the shorter string, making it useful for fuzzy matching.\\n   - Token Sort Ratio: Use this when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order. It tokenizes the strings, sorts the tokens alphabetically, and then calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio.\\n   - Token Set Ratio: Use this when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order and with additional words. It tokenizes the strings, creates a set of unique tokens, and then calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio.\\n\\n3. Practice using ratio matching functions with different examples and datasets:\\n   - You can use the ratio matching functions provided by TheFuzz to compare strings in various scenarios. For example:\\n     - Comparing product names in an e-commerce website to suggest alternative products to customers.\\n     - Matching customer names in a CRM system to detect potential duplicates.\\n     - Finding similar documents in a document management system.', metadata={'source': '/Users/woo/Desktop/studies/learning_scripts/AI_studies/Greg_Kamradt_vids/langchain-tutorials-main/data/thefuzz/.ipynb_checkpoints/Learning_Path-checkpoint.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"4. Explore the limitations and edge cases of ratio matching:\\n   - Ratio matching is a powerful technique for fuzzy string matching, but it has its limitations. Some common limitations include:\\n     - Sensitivity to word order: Simple Ratio does not consider the order of words, which can lead to incorrect matches in some cases.\\n     - Sensitivity to word variations: Ratio matching may not handle word variations well, such as plurals or different verb tenses.\\n     - Sensitivity to input length: Partial Ratio may not produce accurate results if the subset of the shorter string is too small or if the strings are significantly different in length.\\n     - Performance: Ratio matching can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. It's important to consider the performance implications when using these functions.\\n\\nOverall, understanding the different types of ratio matching provided by TheFuzz, their differences, and limitations will help you make informed decisions when applying fuzzy string matching techniques in your projects.\", metadata={'source': '/Users/woo/Desktop/studies/learning_scripts/AI_studies/Greg_Kamradt_vids/langchain-tutorials-main/data/thefuzz/.ipynb_checkpoints/Learning_Path-checkpoint.txt'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"The `thefuzz` library is a Python library that provides fuzzy string matching and similarity functions. It is commonly used for tasks such as string matching, searching, and deduplication. The library offers various algorithms and methods to calculate the similarity between strings, allowing users to find matches even when there are slight differences or variations in the strings.\\n\\nSome common use cases of the `thefuzz` library include:\\n\\n1. Search and retrieval: The library can be used to search for similar strings in a large dataset. This is useful in applications like search engines, autocomplete suggestions, and data deduplication.\\n\\n2. Data cleaning and preprocessing: The library can help in cleaning and preprocessing text data by identifying and handling variations and inconsistencies in strings. This is useful in tasks like data normalization, record linkage, and data quality improvement.\\n\\n3. Natural language processing: The library can be applied in natural language processing tasks such as text classification, document clustering, and text similarity calculations.\\n\\n4. Spell checking and correction: The library's fuzzy matching algorithms can be used to create spell checkers and correct misspelled words by finding the most similar words in a dictionary.\\n\\nOverall, the `thefuzz` library provides a powerful set of tools for working with fuzzy string matching and similarity calculations, making it a valuable resource for various text processing and analysis tasks.\", metadata={'source': '/Users/woo/Desktop/studies/learning_scripts/AI_studies/Greg_Kamradt_vids/langchain-tutorials-main/data/thefuzz/learnGPT/Overview.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='----------------------------\\nQuestion:\\nPlease write me a script using thefuzz to find a subset of an exact match of string1, in string2.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nCertainly! Here\\'s an example script that uses the `thefuzz` library to find a subset of an exact match of `string1` in `string2`:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom thefuzz import fuzz\\n\\ndef find_subset_match(string1, string2):\\n    # Convert the strings to lowercase for case-insensitive matching\\n    string1 = string1.lower()\\n    string2 = string2.lower()\\n\\n    # Find the ratio of similarity between the strings\\n    ratio = fuzz.ratio(string1, string2)\\n\\n    # Check if string1 is a subset of string2\\n    if ratio == 100 and string1 in string2:\\n        return True\\n    else:\\n        return False\\n\\n# Example usage\\nstring1 = \"New York\"\\nstring2 = \"Welcome to New York City!\"\\nis_subset_match = find_subset_match(string1, string2)\\nprint(is_subset_match)  # Output: True\\n```\\n\\nIn this script, the `find_subset_match` function takes two strings as input. It converts the strings to lowercase to perform case-insensitive matching. It then uses `fuzz.ratio` from `thefuzz` to calculate the similarity ratio between the strings. If the ratio is 100 and `string1` is a subset of `string2`, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\\n\\nIn the example usage, it searches for the subset match of \"New York\" in the string \"Welcome to New York City!\" and prints `True` as the output.\\n----------------------------', metadata={'source': '/Users/woo/Desktop/studies/learning_scripts/AI_studies/Greg_Kamradt_vids/langchain-tutorials-main/data/thefuzz/learnGPT/examples.txt'}),\n",

Good luck on your journey to mastering TheFuzz!\\n\\n\\n--------------------\\nSure! Here\\'s some information and examples to help you get started with Milestone 1:\\n\\n1. Understand the purpose and benefits of fuzzy string matching:\\n   - Fuzzy string matching is a technique used to compare strings and determine their similarity, even if they are not an exact match.\\n   - It is useful in various applications such as data cleaning, text search, record linkage, and spell checking.\\n   - The main benefit of fuzzy string matching is that it allows for flexible matching, taking into account differences in spelling, punctuation, and word order.\\n\\n2. Write a simple program using TheFuzz to perform fuzzy string matching:\\n   - TheFuzz is a Python package that provides easy-to-use functions for fuzzy string matching.\\n   - To get started, you need to install TheFuzz using pip. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:\\n     ```\\n     pip install thefuzz\\n     ```\\n   - Once TheFuzz is installed, you can import it and use its functions in your Python program.\\n   - Here\\'s an example of a simple program that uses TheFuzz to perform fuzzy string matching using the `fuzz.ratio()` function:\\n     ```python\\n     from thefuzz import fuzz\\n\\n     string1 = \"apple\"\\n     string2 = \"aple\"', metadata={'source': '/Users/woo/Desktop/studies/learning_scripts/AI_studies/Greg_Kamradt_vids/langchain-tutorials-main/data/thefuzz/learnGPT/Learning_Path.txt'}),\n",

The output is a similarity score of 91, indicating a high degree of similarity between the two strings.\\n\\n   - You can explore other functions provided by TheFuzz, such as `fuzz.partial_ratio()`, `fuzz.token_sort_ratio()`, `fuzz.token_set_ratio()`, and `process.extract()` for more advanced fuzzy string matching techniques.\\n\\nI hope this helps you get started with Milestone 1! Let me know if you have any further questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n1. Learn about the different types of ratio matching provided by TheFuzz, such as Simple Ratio and Partial Ratio:\\n   - TheFuzz provides several ratio matching functions, including:\\n     - `fuzz.ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings. It compares the entire strings and returns a value between 0 and 100, where 100 means the strings are an exact match.\\n     - `fuzz.partial_ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings, but only considers a subset of the shorter string. This is useful when you want to match a portion of one string with another.\\n     - `fuzz.token_sort_ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings, but first tokenizes the strings and sorts the tokens alphabetically. This is useful when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order.\\n     - `fuzz.token_set_ratio()`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio between two strings, but first tokenizes the strings and creates a set of unique tokens. This is useful when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order and with additional words.\\n\\n2. Understand the differences between these ratios and when to use each one:\\n   - Simple Ratio: Use this when you want to compare two strings and get a general sense of their similarity. It compares the entire strings and doesn\\'t consider the order or presence of specific words.\\n   - Partial Ratio: Use this when you want to match a portion of one string with another. It only considers a subset of the shorter string, making it useful for fuzzy matching.\\n   - Token Sort Ratio: Use this when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order. It tokenizes the strings, sorts the tokens alphabetically, and then calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio.\\n   - Token Set Ratio: Use this when you want to match strings that have similar words but in a different order and with additional words. It tokenizes the strings, creates a set of unique tokens, and then calculates the Levenshtein distance ratio.\\n\\n3. Practice using ratio matching functions with different examples and datasets:\\n   - You can use the ratio matching functions provided by TheFuzz to compare strings in various scenarios.

[foxxyz]\\n\\n- Catch generators without lengths. [Jeremiah Lowin]\\n\\n- Fixed python3 issue and deprecated assertion method. [foxxyz]\\n\\n- Fixed some docstrings, typos, python3 string method compatibility,\\n  some errors that crept in during rebase. [foxxyz]\\n\\n- [mod] The lamdba in extract is not needed. [Olivier Le Thanh Duong]\\n\\n  [mod] Pass directly the defaults functions in the args\\n\\n  [mod] itertools.takewhile() can handle empty list just fine no need to test for it\\n\\n  [mod] Shorten extractOne by removing double if\\n\\n  [mod] Use a list comprehention in extract()\\n\\n  [mod] Autopep8 on process.py\\n\\n  [doc] Document make_type_consistent\\n\\n  [mod] bad_chars shortened\\n\\n  [enh] Move regex compilation outside the method, otherwise we don\\'t get the benefit from it\\n\\n  [mod] Don\\'t need all the blah just to redefine method from string module\\n\\n  [mod] Remove unused import\\n\\n  [mod] Autopep8 on string_processing.py\\n\\n  [mod] Rewrote asciidammit without recursion to make it more readable\\n\\n  [mod] Autopep8 on utils.py\\n\\n  [mod] Remove unused import\\n\\n  [doc] Add some doc to fuzz.py\\n\\n  [mod] Move the code to sort string in a separate function\\n\\n  [doc] Docstrings for WRatio, UWRatio\\n\\n\\n- Add note on which package to install.

      "4. Explore the limitations and edge cases of ratio matching:\n",
      "   - Ratio matching is a powerful technique for fuzzy string matching, but it has its limitations. Some common limitations include:\n",
      "     - Sensitivity to word order: Simple Ratio does not consider the order of words, which can lead to incorrect matches in some cases.\n",
      "     - Sensitivity to word variations: Ratio matching may not handle word variations well, such as plurals or different verb tenses.\n",
      "     - Sensitivity to input length: Partial Ratio may not produce accurate results if the subset of the shorter string is too small or if the strings are significantly different in length.\n",
      "     - Performance: Ratio matching can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. It's important to consider the performance implications when using these functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, understanding the different types of ratio matching provided by TheFuzz, their differences, and limitations will help you make informed decisions when applying fuzzy string matching techniques in your projects.\n",

      "Please write me a script using thefuzz to find a subset of an exact match of string1, in string2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Certainly! Here's an example script that uses the `thefuzz` library to find a subset of an exact match of `string1` in `string2`:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from thefuzz import fuzz\n",
      "\n",
      "def find_subset_match(string1, string2):\n",
      "    # Convert the strings to lowercase for case-insensitive matching\n",
      "    string1 = string1.lower()\n",
      "    string2 = string2.lower()\n",
      "\n",
      "    # Find the ratio of similarity between the strings\n",
      "    ratio = fuzz.ratio(string1, string2)\n",
      "\n",
      "    # Check if string1 is a subset of string2\n",
      "    if ratio == 100 and string1 in string2:\n",
      "        return True\n",
      "    else:\n",
      "        return False\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example usage\n",
      "string1 = \"New York\"\n",
      "string2 = \"Welcome to New York City!\"\n",
      "is_subset_match = find_subset_match(string1, string2)\n",
      "print(is_subset_match)  # Output: True\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this script, the `find_subset_match` function takes two strings as input. It converts the strings to lowercase to perform case-insensitive matching. It then uses `fuzz.ratio` from `thefuzz` to calculate the similarity ratio between the strings. If the ratio is 100 and `string1` is a subset of `string2`, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the example usage, it searches for the subset match of \"New York\" in the string \"Welcome to New York City!\" and prints `True` as the output.\n",
      "----------------------------\n",
      "Human: Show me the common use cases of thefuzz, along with code examples\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n",
      "Sure! Here are some common use cases of the `thefuzz` library along with code examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Search and retrieval**: `thefuzz` can be used to search for similar strings in a large dataset. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   from thefuzz import process\n",
      "\n",
      "   choices = [\"New York Mets\", \"New York Yankees\", \"Boston Red Sox\"]\n",
      "   query = \"new york mets\"\n",
      "   results = process.extract(query, choices)\n",
      "\n",
      "   print(results)  # Output: [('New York Mets', 100), ('New York Yankees', 59), ('Boston Red Sox', 29)]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   In this example, `process.extract` is used to find strings in the `choices` list that are similar to the `query` string. The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a matching string from the `choices` list and a similarity score.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Data cleaning and preprocessing**: `thefuzz` can be used to identify and handle variations and inconsistencies in strings. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   from thefuzz import fuzz\n",
      "\n",
      "   string1 = \"New York Mets\"\n",
      "   string2 = \"new york mets\"\n",
      "   similarity = fuzz.ratio(string1.lower(), string2.lower())\n",
      "\n",
      "   print(similarity)  # Output: 100\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   In this example, `fuzz.ratio` is used to calculate the similarity between `string1` and `string2`. By converting the strings to lowercase before calculating the similarity, we can handle variations in case.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Spell checking and correction**: `thefuzz` can be used to create spell checkers and correct misspelled words. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   from thefuzz import process\n",
      "\n",
      "   dictionary = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\", \"grape\"]\n",
      "   misspelled_word = \"aple\"\n",
      "   correction = process.extractOne(misspelled_word, dictionary)\n",
      "\n",
      "   print(correction)  # Output: ('apple', 80)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   In this example, `process.extractOne` is used to find the word in the `dictionary` list that is most similar to the `misspelled_word`. The function returns a tuple containing the most similar word and a similarity score.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Natural language processing**: `thefuzz` can be used in natural language processing tasks such as document clustering. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   from thefuzz import fuzz\n",
      "\n",
      "   doc1 = \"The sky is blue.\"\n",
      "   doc2 = \"The sky was clear and blue.\"\n",
      "   similarity = fuzz.token_sort_ratio(doc1, doc2)\n",
      "\n",
      "   print(similarity)  # Output: 64\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   In this example, `fuzz.token_sort_ratio` is used to calculate the similarity between `doc1` and `doc2`. This function tokenizes the strings, sorts the tokens, and then calculates the similarity, making it useful for comparing sentences or short documents.\n"
