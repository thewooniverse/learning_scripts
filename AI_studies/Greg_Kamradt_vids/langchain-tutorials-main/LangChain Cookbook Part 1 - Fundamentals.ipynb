    "### **What is LangChain?**\n",
    "> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**~~TL~~DR**: LangChain makes the complicated parts of working & building with AI models easier. It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with it's environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why LangChain?**\n",
    "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "   >> Need to learn to customize chains\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Speed 🚢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Community 👥** - Wonderful discord and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This cookbook will not cover all aspects of LangChain. It's contents have been curated to get you to building & impact as quick as possible. For more, please check out [LangChain Conceptual Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Update Oct '23: This notebook has been expanded from it's original form*\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need an OpenAI api key to follow this tutorial. You can have it as an environement variable, in an .env file where this jupyter notebook lives, or insert it below where 'YourAPIKey' is. Have if you have questions on this, put these instructions into [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)."

    "• Data Ingestion: Document loaders enable the loading of data from diverse sources such as files, databases, APIs, webpages, or cloud storage. They handle the complexities of reading and extracting data from different formats and sources.\n",

    "• Standardization: Document loaders convert the loaded data into a standardized document format that can be easily processed by downstream components. This ensures consistency and compatibility across different data sources.\n",

    "• Metadata Extraction: Document loaders often extract metadata associated with the loaded data, such as file information, timestamps, source URLs, or any other relevant information. This metadata can be used for further processing or analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Lazy Loading: Some document loaders support lazy loading, where data is loaded into memory only when needed. This can be useful for handling large datasets or optimizing resource usage.\n",

These loaders simplify the process of data ingestion and standardization, allowing for seamless integration of different data sources into the Langchain pipeline."

    "Langchain provides different types of text splitters that can be used to split text into smaller chunks. Here are some of the commonly used text splitters in Langchain:\n",
    "\n",
    "• CharacterTextSplitter: This text splitter splits the text based on characters. It allows you to specify a separator character or sequence to split the text into chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "• SentenceTextSplitter: The SentenceTextSplitter splits the text into chunks based on sentence boundaries. It uses natural language processing techniques to identify sentence boundaries and create chunks accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "• TokenTextSplitter: The TokenTextSplitter splits the text into chunks based on tokens. It uses tokenization techniques to break the text into tokens and create chunks of a specified size.\n",
    "\n",
    "• RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: This text splitter recursively splits the text based on characters. It tries different characters as separators to split the text into chunks, ensuring that the chunks are not larger than the specified size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These text splitters offer flexibility in splitting text based on different criteria such as characters, sentences, or tokens. You can choose the appropriate text splitter based on your specific requirements and the nature of the text you are working with."

    "Langchain provides various types of retrievers that serve different purposes and are commonly used for specific tasks. Here are some of the different types of retrievers available in Langchain:\n",
    "\n",
    "• SelfQueryRetriever: The SelfQueryRetriever allows you to generate vector store queries using an LLM (Language Model) and a vector store. It combines the power of language models and vector stores to perform retrieval based on semantic similarity and metadata filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "• ParentDocumentRetriever: The ParentDocumentRetriever retrieves smaller chunks of documents and their parent documents. It allows you to look up smaller chunks while returning larger context, which is useful for tasks like document summarization or generating context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "• EnsembleRetriever: The EnsembleRetriever combines multiple retrievers or retrieval algorithms to retrieve documents from different sources or using different methods. It enables you to leverage the strengths of multiple retrievers to improve retrieval performance and coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "• MergerRetriever: The MergerRetriever merges the results of multiple retrievers into a single set of documents. It is useful when you want to combine the outputs of different retrievers or retrieval methods to obtain a comprehensive set of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "• KNNRetriever: The KNNRetriever performs k-nearest neighbors (KNN) retrieval based on vector similarity. It retrieves the k most similar documents to a given query vector, allowing you to find documents that are closest in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "• GoogleDocumentAIWarehouseRetriever: The GoogleDocumentAIWarehouseRetriever is a retriever based on Google's Document AI Warehouse. It allows you to retrieve documents from the Document AI Warehouse, which is a multimodal database for building AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the retrievers available in Langchain. Each retriever serves a specific purpose and is commonly used for tasks such as semantic search, document summarization, context-aware responses, or combining multiple retrieval methods. The choice of retriever depends on the specific requirements of your application and the type of retrieval task you want to perform."
