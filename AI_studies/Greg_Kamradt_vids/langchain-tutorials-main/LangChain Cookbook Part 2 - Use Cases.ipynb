    "1. Inspire you to build\n",
    "2. Provide an introductory understanding of the main use cases of LangChain via [ELI5](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/eli5/#:~:text=ELI5%20is%20short%20for%20%E2%80%9CExplain,a%20complicated%20question%20or%20problem.) examples and code snippets.

    "### **What is LangChain?**\n",
    "> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "*[Source](https://blog.langchain.dev/announcing-our-10m-seed-round-led-by-benchmark/#:~:text=LangChain%20is%20a%20framework%20for%20developing%20applications%20powered%20by%20language%20models)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR**: LangChain makes the complicated parts of working & building with AI models easier. It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with its environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why LangChain?**\n",
    "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed 🚢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community 👥** - Wonderful [discord](https://discord.gg/6adMQxSpJS) and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Main Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Summarization** - Express the most important facts about a body of text or chat interaction\n",
    "* **Question and Answering Over Documents** - Use information held within documents to answer questions or query\n",
    "* **Extraction** - Pull structured data from a body of text or an user query\n",
    "* **Evaluation** - Understand the quality of output from your application\n",
    "* **Querying Tabular Data** - Pull data from databases or other tabular source\n",
    "* **Code Understanding** - Reason about and digest code\n",
    "* **Interacting with APIs** - Query APIs and interact with the outside world\n",
    "* **Chatbots** - A framework to have a back and forth interaction with a user combined with memory in a chat interface\n",
    "* **Agents** - Use LLMs to make decisions about what to do next. Enable these decisions with tools.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### **Authors Note:**\n",

    "* This cookbook will not cover all aspects of LangChain. It's contents have been curated to get you to building & impact as quick as possible. For more, please check out [LangChain Technical Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html)\n",
    "* This notebook assumes is that you've seen part 1 of this series [Fundamentals](https://github.com/gkamradt/langchain-tutorials/blob/main/LangChain%20Cookbook%20Part%201%20-%20Fundamentals.ipynb). This notebook is focused on what to do and how to apply those fundamentals.\n",
    "* You'll notice I repeat import statements throughout the notebook. My intention is to lean on the side of clarity and help you see the full code block in one spot. No need to go back and forth to see when we imported a package.\n",
    "* We use the default models throughout the notebook, at the time of writing they were davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. You would no doubt get better results with GPT4\n",

You can summarize any piece of text, but use cases span from summarizing calls, articles, books, academic papers, legal documents, user history, a table, or financial documents. It's super helpful to have a tool which can summarize information quickly.\n",

It highlights the value of the \"Don't be evil\" principle for Google and the tamagotchi effect, where startups feel a responsibility to take care of their users. The author concludes that benevolence can make startups resilient and attractive to investors. Being good in the startup world can attract support, help make better decisions, and have significant benefits. The author reflects on their skepticism towards the concept of being \"good\" but argues that it can be effective as a strategy and design specification for software. They also discuss the undervaluation of starting a company with benevolent aims and the lack of accountability in many explicitly benevolent projects.\n"
