    "What are Prompts? Prompts involve instructions and context passed to a language model to achieve a desired task\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the practice of developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs or LLMs) for a variety of applications. This also applies to other models like image generation models such as DALL-E, stable diffisuion models.\n",
    "- Prompt engineering is a usefull skill for AI engineers and researchers to improve and efficiently use language models.\n",

    "### Elements of a Prompt\n",
    "A prompt is composed with the following components:\n",

    "You can get very different results using a LM when using different settings. One important setting is controlling how deterministic the model is when generating completion for prompts:\n",

    "- Generally, keep them low if you are looking for exact answers\n",
    "- Keep them high if you are looking for more diverse responses.\n",
