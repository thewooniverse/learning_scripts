# Hallucination and providing out of context information

Answer
The RetrievalQA chain retrieves and processes documents based on the provided context, but it may still generate answers that appear to be outside of the explicitly provided context. This can happen due to a few reasons:

• Relevant but not explicitly mentioned information: The retrieved documents may contain relevant information that is related to the context but not explicitly mentioned within it. The chain leverages this additional information to generate a more comprehensive answer.

• Inferred information: The language model used in the RetrievalQA chain has been trained on a vast amount of data and can make inferences based on the context and its understanding of the query. It may generate answers that are inferred from the provided context, even if the exact information is not explicitly present.

• Contextual understanding: The language model has contextual understanding and can draw upon its knowledge to provide relevant information beyond the explicitly provided context. It can make connections and provide insights based on its understanding of the topic.


It's important to note that the RetrievalQA chain does not perform external searches or access information beyond the provided context. However, it can utilize the retrieved documents and the language model's capabilities to generate answers that may appear to go beyond the explicitly provided context.

## Specifying in the query / question;
Specifying to "stay in the context during the question / query does help with preventing hallucination"
