## PP1: Learning GPT
Learning GPT is a continuous project that will assist me with various learning features that leverage LLMs. Eventually, it may inform a full fledged product with a subscription model off of it as well (that can arbitrage some tokens).

FEATURES;
Given a full directory of texts and PDFs... it can:
- Create an overview and summary of the contents of the directory
- Give its real world / common use cases along with examples

- Develop a learning path from basics to mastery
- Develop a milestone based project to practice and build mastery
- Develop quizzes to test your knowledge
-- Spaced recognition and testing
-- Tracking your progress and mastery towards mastery
- Telegram integration to ping notifications on a timely basis to test.


### Development Roadmap:
- Summarize the directory and the important lessons covered and key concepts
- Turn them into multiple choice questions
- Integrate into Telegram and test the user on it
- Track progress and incorrect questions (similar to Eidetic does)

Every time quiz() is called, it should populate with everything that the user needs to be reminded of.
Every time they get it wrong;
Topic mastery;


### Architecture and technologies:
- Lanchain
- OpenAI API
