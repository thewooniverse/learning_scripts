## PP1: Learning GPT
Learning GPT is a continuous project that will assist me with various learning features that leverage LLMs. Eventually, it may inform a full fledged product with a subscription model off of it as well (that can arbitrage some tokens).



### Development Roadmap:
- Summarize the directory and the important lessons covered and key concepts
- Turn them into multiple choice questions
- Integrate into Telegram and test the user on it
- Track progress and incorrect questions (similar to Eidetic does)

Every time quiz() is called, it should populate with everything that the user needs to be reminded of.
Every time they get it wrong;
Topic mastery;
