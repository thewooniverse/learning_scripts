# Self Developed Projects
Here we define the various projects and things I would like to build using Langchain and ChatGPT
Often times projects that increase my own productivity and learning should be prioritized in order to accelerate my own progress (compounding).

These are projects that I will develop myself, often 


## PP1: Learning GPT
Learning GPT is a continuous project that will assist me with 

### Feature 1: quizzing and testing
- When given a directory, it will generate quizzes around the content of the directory to test my understanding. This can eventually be expanded into walking through the whole repository of my own learning_scripts - to occasionally test things.
-- This also means that I could add some logic in terms of the way / convention of how files are organized and directory / naming convention is being done.
-- Eventually, this will be run potentailly once per day, or once after every new chapter of things have been learnt.

- Spaced Repetition and progress tracking

### Feature 2:





## PP2: question docs GPT
This will allow me to learn new libraries faster



## PP3: dev_assist GPT
This will allow me to develop faster;
