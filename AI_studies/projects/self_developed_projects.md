# Self Developed Projects
Here we define the various projects and things I would like to build using Langchain and ChatGPT
Often times projects that increase my own productivity and learning should be prioritized in order to accelerate my own progress (compounding).

These are projects that I will develop myself, often 


## PP1: learningGPT
learningGPT is a continuous project that assists and accelerates my learning of new things (primarily, new libraries, programming languages and modules).

Given a full directory of texts and PDFs... it can:
- Create an overview and summary of the contents of the directory
- Give its real world / common use cases along with examples

- Develop a learning path from basics to mastery
- Develop a milestone based project to practice and build mastery
- Develop quizzes to test your knowledge
-- Spaced recognition and testing
-- Tracking your progress and mastery towards mastery



## PP2: question docs GPT
question_docs is a practice project that was used to practice Langchain, it works well as a initial tool / practice for questioning against documentations.



## PP3: dev_assist GPT
dev_assist GPT is an AI application that helps me leverage LLMs to complete the more tedious parts of the development workflow; 

### Feature 1: Code feedback 
Using LLMs to give feedback on how I have written code in general.

### Feature 2: Write documentation and bug fix
Using LLMs to generate READMEs, documentations and change / bug fix notes based on the code changes.

### Feature 3: Refactoring and performance upgrades
Using LLMs to refactor specific parts of the code, and measure performance etc..
