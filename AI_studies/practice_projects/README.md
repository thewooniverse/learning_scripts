Project workflow:

1. Persistent Agent -> chat agent with chat history, retrieval and basically ChatGPT with actually persistent memory storage
2. TeleGPT -> Telegram integration of ChatGPT, building on top of Persistent Agent; having chat history for each chat room.
3. SearchAgentGPT -> Agent that queries itself, if it is beyond cutoff date it will search the web for the best answer; then build onto TeleGPT for this type of querying as well.
4. ImageSearchGPT -> Agent that can search the images provided; and build on top of TeleGPT with this as well.

--- The milestone here would definitely be in having a very robust, feature rich and reliable ChatGPT interface on telegram, which I can use to develop learning paths and stuff like that and always, at any moment query.
I could also then use this to create a type of "AI council" of sorts! And also begin to promote it to a certain degree.
