Langchain makes LLMs...
- Data Aware (load context)
- Agentic (can take actions)

Use cases are infinite when this is possible:
- Learning
- Personal Assistance
- Combining LLMs and analysis with proprietary data sets


![Local Image](v1_d1.png)
LLM Wrappers -> connect to Hugging Face, GPT, Cohere
Prompt Templates -> don't have to hard code prompts
Indexes -> relevant information retrieval

Chains -> enable us to assemble parts to build a chain of actions, a full app that does complex things

Agents -> allows LLMs to interact with its environment;



-----
python-dotevn -> manage env variables;
langcahin -> langchain library
pinecone-client -> vector store
